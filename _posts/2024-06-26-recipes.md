All my recipes are on instagram, just click the link top right....
We’ll use simple and seasonal ingredients (I grow much of my own
veg), using basic tools and techniques, whilst having fun and always
keeping it interesting with herbs & spices. You know yourself better
than anyone else. A little is more than nothing and if you would
like to learn some vegetarian and shy recipes,
I’ll show you the Lo-Lo way to go.....
