# The Scarlet Lo-Lo Cooking Show
https://ibb.co/9gyR5y0
Lolo is low salt and low sugar!                         (and only a little fat)
Every week I share one of my favourite recipes with you, to help you take control of your own health by using principles that are natural, environmentally respectful and sustainable, whilst enjoying wonderful meals.
Expect simple, healthy vegetarian food, with the occasional guest cook for fish. We’ll also have some nice but naughty sweet treats, of course!
I’m not here to prescribe what you should do, but just to share what helps me feel good, retain health, and live in tune with nature. I’ve collected and developed many favourite recipes over the years and also share heritage recipes, which deserve to be re-discovered.
We’ll use simple and seasonal ingredients (I grow my own veg) with basic tools and techniques, whilst having fun and always keeping it interesting with herbs & spices.
You know yourself better than anyone else. A little is more than nothing and if you would like to learn some vegetarian and fishy recipes, I’ll show you the lo-lo way to go.
